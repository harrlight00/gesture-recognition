<h2> Problem Definition </h2>
<p>
The problem is to use openCV to differentiate 3 gestures, including a peace sign and an open hand as static gestures, and a finger-wave as a motion.
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Method and Implementation </h2>
<p>
After creating a skeleton that could input and parse video, we processed the video using various openCV implentations.  
First, we used cv2.cvtColor to transform the data to grayscale, then used Gaussian Blur and Image Thresholding to implement 
a version of background differencing.  After performing the same process on our template data, this allowed us to easily use 
template matching to match static gestures with our target gestures: a peace sign, an open hand, and a single finger for the 
motion detection.  We first checked for motion data by matching the finger template to a background reduced mask and tracked the
motion of that finger wave.  If we did not find motion data, we used template matching to check for the peace sign or the open 
hand gesture.  We also made sure to add a template picture for both the right and left hand for each gesture, so that our function 
would properly mark either hand.  Our system can only recognize one thing at a time, so unfortunately if someone put up 
double peace signs, it would only recognize one.  After using template matching on our live video feed, if a match was found 
for any gesture, we would draw a rectangle around it in an assigned color, and affix a label of the same color to it (as 
seen in section (#1).
</p>

<p>
We created a main function to capture and process the video.

<h2>(#1) Successes and Failures</h2>
<p>
Here are examples of success and failure for each gesture (As previously stated, the background greatly influenced the success or failure of the gesture)
</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td> Peace Sign (Success) </td>
  <td> <img src="./images/PeaceSuccess.PNG"> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> Peace Sign (Failure) </td>
  <td> <img src="./images/PeaceFail.PNG"> </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The detection succeeds against a white background, but fails against a darker background</p>
<tbody><table>
<tr>
  <td> Open Hand (Success) </td>
  <td> <img src="./images/HandSuccess.PNG"> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> Open Hand (Failure) </td>
  <td> <img src="./images/HandFail.PNG"> </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The detection succeeds against a white background, but fails against a darker background</p>
</p>
<tbody><table>
<tr>
  <td> Finger Wave (Success) </td>
  <td> <img src="./images/WaveSuccess.PNG"> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> Finger Wave (Failure) </td>
  <td> <img src="./images/WaveFail.PNG"> </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The detection succeeds if the background is stagnant, it can fail if the background is moving</p>
</p>

<h2>(#2) Confusion Matrix</h2>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td> <img src="./images/Matrix.PNG"> </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>

<hr>

<h2>(#3) Techniques used</h2>
<p>
OpenCV video access, Background differencing, Template matching, Tracking position of moving objects, Image thresholding, Gaussian blurring
</p>

<hr>

<h2>(#4) Future</h2>
<p>
In the future, it may be beneficial to acquire a better camera, as well as to use multiple test subjects in the formation of our confusion matrix.
</p>

<hr>

<h2> Conclusions </h2>
<p>
OpenCV is an extremely useful tool for analyzing live video data, but unfortunately, what you can do with it is drastically limited by hardware.
